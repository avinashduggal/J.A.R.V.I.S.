## Team Tower Runners.
Team Tower Runners focuses on solving the Obstacle Tower challenge using machine learning. Obstacle Tower is a procedurally generated environment designed to evaluate an AI agent's ability to generalize across multiple tasks such as vision, locomotion, planning, and puzzle-solving. The agent's goal is to navigate through increasingly complex floors, adapting to new obstacles and challenges. Our aim is to develop a reinforcement learning-based solution capable of learning effective strategies to improve performance across different tower configurations.
