## Summary of the Project
The goal of this project is to develop an AI agent in Minecraft that can automatically manage a small farm using reinforcement learning. The agent's task is to walk through a predefined farming area, detect when crops (e.g., wheat, carrots, or potatoes) are fully grown, harvest them, and immediately replant seeds in the harvested spots. The agent will take as input the current state of each block in the farming area, such as whether a crop is fully grown, freshly planted, or empty, as well as its own position and inventory status. The output will be the sequence of actions the agent performs, such as harvesting, replanting, or moving to a new block. This project has practical applications in simulating automated farming systems and exploring resource optimization in controlled environments. It also serves as a simple yet effective testbed for multi-step decision-making and task prioritization in RL.

## AI/ML Algorithms
An algorithm that the team anticipates on using for our project is Q-learning that uses a model free approach for traing the agent to maximize crops harvested.

## AI Tool Usage
At the moment of this proposal creation, we currently do not know if we will use AI tools, and in the event we do, we do not know which AI Tools we shall utilize.
